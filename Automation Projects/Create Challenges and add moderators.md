This project is an automation project that directly creates challenges and adds moderators for those challenges so the loop will run at max 5 times
But in the hacker-rank website we can only make atmost 5 challenges. 

With this project i have a good knowledge on async-await,promises,Async programmes.

IN this project when run the code it directly goes to the hacker-rank website.Does the login for the user.Goes to the challenge section and create as many as 3 new challenges at a time because of restriction.
