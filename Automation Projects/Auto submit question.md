This is also a part of automation project.

In this project i have written a script that auto submits programming problem on the hacker-rank website.
Firstly it goes to the question then goes to the editorial where the solution of the programs are already given .Then it finds the code written in c++ language after finding it.It copies the code then comes back to the question again and pastes the copied code on the IDE,runs it on example test-cases and submits the program for passing all the test-cases
